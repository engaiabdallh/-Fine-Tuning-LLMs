# distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-emotions-dataset

This model is a fine-tuned version of [distilbert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased) on the emotion dataset.
It achieves the following results on the evaluation set:
- Loss: 0.2428
- Accuracy: 0.9395
- F1: 0.9396

## Model description

The model has been trained to classify text inputs into distinct emotional categories based on the fine-tuned understanding of the emotions dataset. 
The fine-tuned model has demonstrated high accuracy and F1 scores on the evaluation set.

## Intended uses & limitations

#### Intended Uses
- Sentiment analysis
- Emotional classification in text
- Emotion-based recommendation systems

#### Limitations
- May show biases based on the training dataset
- Optimized for emotional classification and may not cover nuanced emotional subtleties

## Training and evaluation data
Emotions dataset with labeled emotional categories [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion).

#### The emotional categories are as follows:
- LABEL_0: sadness 
- LABEL_1: joy
- LABEL_2: love
- LABEL_3: anger
- LABEL_4: fear
- LABEL_5: surprise
